This is where the Django Virtual Environment Files reside.
I am not including those files here as it does not make sense
to do so.
These files are automatically generated by the system on running
commands, beginning with ''pip install django''.
Complete set of commands required to install django, create 
virtual environment, get the server up and running and more can be 
found in the Official Django Documentation, or anywhere else on 
the internet.
I will also be posting the documents given to me by my instructor
for the course "Full Stack Development Lab - Django" in the 
Documentation Repository, which will be coming soon.
Thank you for being here!
